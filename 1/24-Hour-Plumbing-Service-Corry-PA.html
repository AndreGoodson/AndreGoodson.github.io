<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their appropriate orientation will be labeled. These 2 pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly meshed hold the install ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion install is totally and firmly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed properly, you must not have the ability to get rid of the cushion mount without considerable extending and pulling, and the mount ring needs to rotate freely around it.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Corry PA</h3>
<p>When your hot water heater starts to leak, you need to replace it quickly. We'll show you how to install your own gas water heater in less than a day. Even if you do not need a new hot water heater today, possibilities are you will within the next few years. Water heaters tend to last 7 to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this post is likewise for you. If you're useful with basic tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, replacing a water heater isn't hard.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
