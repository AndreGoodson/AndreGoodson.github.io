<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our customers is kept devoid of damaging contaminants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the potable water supply. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>
