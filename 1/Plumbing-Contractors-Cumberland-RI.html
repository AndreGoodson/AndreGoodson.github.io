For instance, the standard instructions for toilet tank flush valve replacement include, Beware of completely scratching the flush valve seat", shut off main valve", disconnect hoses", and be careful not to split the toilet tank." Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your brand-new tank flush valve does not work is look for leaks" and make adjustments."
