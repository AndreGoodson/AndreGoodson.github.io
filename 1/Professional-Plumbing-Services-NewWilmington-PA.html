<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most destructive and prevalent water problems: hard water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern house. Scale develops in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically reduces the life-span of home appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice makers. Difficult water ruins warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
