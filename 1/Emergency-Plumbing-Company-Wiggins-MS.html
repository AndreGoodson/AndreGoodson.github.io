<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
