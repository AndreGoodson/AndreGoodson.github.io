<p>In some cases a clog can be triggered due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the concern if this is the case.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
