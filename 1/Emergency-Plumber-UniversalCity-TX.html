<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
