Flushing the water heating tank should be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent location to begin trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing system is below the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the wetness most.</p>
