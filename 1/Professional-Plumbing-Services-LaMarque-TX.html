<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
