<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a considerable pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
