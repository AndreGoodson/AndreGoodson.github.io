<h3>What Kinds Of Tools Do Plumbers Use Logansport IN</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
