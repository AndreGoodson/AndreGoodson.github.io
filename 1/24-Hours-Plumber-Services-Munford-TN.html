<p>Concealed water leaks are frequently difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need somewhat different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
