<p>When pipes are organized into a vertical form it is referred to as a hydrostatic loop. In this setup the loop need to be higher than 33 feet to work appropriately. When created by doing this it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water supply. Plumb Crazy Plumbing uses a standard 30 day service warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year guarantee on replacement plumbing jobs.</p>
<p>Blending evaporated salt with rock salt is not suggested, as this might clog the softening reservoir.
