<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages offered changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet simpler, new toilet bolts are additional long. That indicates you need to cut off the extending ends later with a hacksaw. But first connect the water line, flush the toilet a couple of times and check for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut until you have actually done these final checks lets you easily remove and reset the toilet if you discover any problems.</p>

<p>Sinkholes do not only take place in your lawn, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks.
