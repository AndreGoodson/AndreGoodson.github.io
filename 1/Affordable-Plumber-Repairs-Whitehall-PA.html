<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Whitehall PA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be needed to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After an initial inspection and testing of a newly installed backflow preventer, the water customer is required to have the backflow preventer checked on a yearly basis.</p>

In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to enter the valve and bring back pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
