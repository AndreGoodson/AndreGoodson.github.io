So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who deal with basic repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in renovating jobs and additions.</p>
