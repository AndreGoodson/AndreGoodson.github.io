<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it.

The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
