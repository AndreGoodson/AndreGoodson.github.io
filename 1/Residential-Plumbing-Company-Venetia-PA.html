This post is also for you if yours is getting old. If you're helpful with fundamental tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, changing a water heater isn't tough.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>Common fixes do not fix the issue. If it appears you're constantly experiencing plumbing problems, it's probably a concern you can't fix without professional help.
