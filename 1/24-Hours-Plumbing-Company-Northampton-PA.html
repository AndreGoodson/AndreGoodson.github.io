<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix it Yourself in Northampton PA!</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
