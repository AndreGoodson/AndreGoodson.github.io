<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in Troy MO</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
