Gravity-fed flush toilets use the force of gravity and a siphon "pull-through" action to empty the bowl. Look for gravity-fed toilets offering high efficiency to efficiently and quietly get rid of waste. CIPP: Apollo utilizes this technology to repair a harmed pipe. The professional reaches the pipe through an open access A flexible tube or lining is blown or pulled into the old pipe. The liner material, which is covered with resin, is pumped up.
