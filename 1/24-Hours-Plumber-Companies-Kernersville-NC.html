<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I bought independently from the disposal unit.

<p>At least when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so assists get rid of the sediment. If you find a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the exact same product and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your whole house when you spot a leak.</p>
