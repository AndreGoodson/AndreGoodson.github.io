<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of designated usages around your home.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, fixtures and products used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and modification of all piping, fixtures, plumbing devices, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage facilities; venting systems and public or personal supply of water systems, within or adjacent to any building or structure.</p>
