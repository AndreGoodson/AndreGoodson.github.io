<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than building up on surface areas.
