<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what occurs when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots.

Watch out for moist, green spots in your lawn, a relentless sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common signs of root invasion.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
