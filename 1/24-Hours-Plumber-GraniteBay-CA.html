Watch out for moist, green spots in your lawn, a relentless sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common signs of root invasion.</p>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
