<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
