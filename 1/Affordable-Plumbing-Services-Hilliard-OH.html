<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are harmless, however over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In severe cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
