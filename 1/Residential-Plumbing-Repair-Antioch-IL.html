<h3>Gas Line Inspection in Antioch Illinois</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the recently cleaned main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the task was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
