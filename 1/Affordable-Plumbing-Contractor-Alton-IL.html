<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
