<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Metuchen NJ</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers manage all types of work.

<p>Backflow prevention protects safe and clean water supply from possible risks. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year.
