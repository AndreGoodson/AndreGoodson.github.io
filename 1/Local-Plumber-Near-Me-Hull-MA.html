<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, damaged pipe out while changing it with a brand-new one at the exact same time. We did a follow-up call to the house owner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her lawn. Task well done: You do not wish to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a qualified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's a permanent solution for the entire plumbing system in your home or service. We turn off the water system, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's great to go for you.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you cash and time in addition to safeguard your health in the future. After softening a big quantity of hard water, the exchange medium becomes covered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium must be charged or regrowed (Figure 1)when this occurs.
