Fire defense system are developed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be created and installed to fulfill that specific threat or need. An airplane hangar will need a very various fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise vary greatly.</p>
