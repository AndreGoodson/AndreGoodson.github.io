<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your house. When you experience obstructions in numerous drains simultaneously in your house, then that generally implies that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in several locations and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>A few of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or too much food being disposed down the drain. We will typically advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the intensity of the circumstance. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
