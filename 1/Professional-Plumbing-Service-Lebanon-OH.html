I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
