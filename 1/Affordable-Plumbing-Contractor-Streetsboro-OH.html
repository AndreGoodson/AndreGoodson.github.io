<p>The program achieves its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of ideal rules and guidelines for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. When figuring out the solidity of water, there are series of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey stated that both Belding and Greenville city water steps around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally hard water, leaving indicators like spotty glasses and soap residue that is next to difficult to get rid of. With well water, these symptoms may also be paired with iron stains and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than products including severe chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
