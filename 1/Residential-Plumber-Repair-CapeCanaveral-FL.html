<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at CapeCanaveral FL</h3>
<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - primarily with sinks. In most cases, a sink drain issue is triggered by extreme impurities or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps. While there are several chemical drain cleaning choices, sometimes this can trigger more damage than help. Anytime you find a clogged drain, connect to Resurrection Plumbing to detect the concern and suggest the ideal repairs.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>4. Attach a PVC disposer elbow to the garbage disposer and install a new PVC trap and drainpipe to the stub out in the wall. Commercial Plumbing: We do light commercial work too.
