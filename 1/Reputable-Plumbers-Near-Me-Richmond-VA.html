<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
