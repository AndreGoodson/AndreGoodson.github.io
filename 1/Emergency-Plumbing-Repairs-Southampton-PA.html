<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
