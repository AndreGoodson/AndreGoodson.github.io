<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
