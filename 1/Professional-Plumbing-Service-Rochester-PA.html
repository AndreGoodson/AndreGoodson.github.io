<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, as well as inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
