<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is normal in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
