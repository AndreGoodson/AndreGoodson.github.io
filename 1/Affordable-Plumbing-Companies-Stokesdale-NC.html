<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, determining. An authorization is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.
