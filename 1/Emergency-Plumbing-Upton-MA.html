<p>Lots of bad things are being said on this post about liners. I discover that numerous old time plumbers are not educated on liners and have no clue on what they are saying.

<p>Sometimes you understand you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to pinpoint the specific area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you countless dollars in repairs.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
