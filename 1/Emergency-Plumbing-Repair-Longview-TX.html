<p>Woodbury, in addition to lots of other neighborhoods and organizations, has discovered the very best method to avoid these spots from taking place is by minimizing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regenerating" describes the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, lots of water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be fixed by simply resetting your water softener to remove less firmness or to run longer between regrowth cycles.</p>
