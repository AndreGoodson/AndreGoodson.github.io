That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
