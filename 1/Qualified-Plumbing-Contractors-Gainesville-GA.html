<p>We utilize quality items. In many circumstances, we try to use versatile carbon steel to carry natural gas from the outside gas source to home appliances. Versatile steel eliminates the need to cut and piece private sections of piping together which lowers potential for gas leakages.

Tracer wire is frequently used with versatile carbon steel to alert the gas company when a leak happens. We can ensure that these lines are working correctly.</p>
