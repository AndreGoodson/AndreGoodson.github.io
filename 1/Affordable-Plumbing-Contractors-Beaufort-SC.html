<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Beaufort SC</h3>
<p>How to get a plumbing contractor's license includes a few additional steps to reach your end goal - to become a legal contractor.

Each state has its own rules and guidelines when getting a contractor's license, see this short article for more extensive details.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were extremely professional and did an amazing job. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining only appears when hot water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
