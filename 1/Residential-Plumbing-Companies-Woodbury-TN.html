<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
