A permit and inspections are needed for a lot of residential jobs including patios, additions, and equipment such as air conditioners and hot water heater. If new work is performed such as replacement of gas piping, a strategy may be required to obtain the authorization.</p>

Backsiphonage happens when there is a negative pressure in the water circulation system, which draws the water from a personal water supply into the public water supply. This can occur at any time, such as throughout a water main break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
