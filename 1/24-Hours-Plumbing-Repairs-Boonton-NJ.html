<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take obligation if it leaked now due to the fact that of some undefined oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, given that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
