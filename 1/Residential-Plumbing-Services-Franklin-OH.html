<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a forecasted life expectancy of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another efficient technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
