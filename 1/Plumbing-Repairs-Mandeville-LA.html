<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the faulty pipes replaced. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually struggles with rust and does not have the durability these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
