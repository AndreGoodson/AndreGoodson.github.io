<p>The next step we should perform in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to assure the line is properly flushed.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the building envelope including listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a system, fixture, or sub-system  group is replaced, a license and inspection will not be needed. This will not preclude the licensee from obtaining licenses and inspections for such work if so preferred.</p>

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
