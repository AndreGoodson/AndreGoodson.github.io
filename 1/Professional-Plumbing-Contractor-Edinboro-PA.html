<p>There are a couple of types of water heaters to choose from, each design has its disadvantages and advantages. The best one for you depends on just how much hot water you use, and the heating technique (electrical energy, gas, oil).

<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
