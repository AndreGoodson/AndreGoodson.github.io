<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it includes. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
