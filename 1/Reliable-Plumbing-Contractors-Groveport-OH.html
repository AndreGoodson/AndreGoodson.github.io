<p>As pipes age, the most likely they are to burst and wear away. This is just enhanced depending upon the product of the pipes utilized in your home. If you live in a structure that is around 50 years old, there is a great chance that your pipes were made with galvanized metal which is most likely to burst as it ages. Once your home starts to approach this age, you must begin getting more regular inspections and maintenance look at your plumbing to make certain you do not have any leakages or damage developing in your house.</p>

A small round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank when you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer.
