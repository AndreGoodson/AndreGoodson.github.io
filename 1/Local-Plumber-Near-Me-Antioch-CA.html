<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale build-up in homes and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is easier and more affordable than other softening systems on the marketplace today that utilize zeolites, which should be restored utilizing salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water use and high pressure.</p>

<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might happen. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
