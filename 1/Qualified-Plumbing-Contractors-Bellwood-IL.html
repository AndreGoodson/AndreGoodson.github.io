A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test cocks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health dangers but works against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire fighting or when a water main breaks.
