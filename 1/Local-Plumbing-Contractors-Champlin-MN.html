Channeling takes place when the incoming hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

However, lots of water softeners regrow too often, when the filter medium really isn't full. This can be fixed by merely resetting your water softener to remove less firmness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>
