<p>In basic, toilets are quite easy to repair and operate.

Harmed toilets can do some truly substantial, expensive, and ... smelly damage to a home.

<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
