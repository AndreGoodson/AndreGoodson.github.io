<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Florence OR</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
