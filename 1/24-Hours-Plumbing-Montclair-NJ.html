<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your house, then that usually means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in multiple places and any mix of drains. For instance, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>

To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
