<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an abrupt reduction in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water main breaks.

Storage tank hot water heater are commonly discovered in most houses. Their parts are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's required.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
