Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)
