<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic style of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least costly, but also the least reliable choice. These gadgets are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one need to be installed at every control valve. Sprinkler Warehouse does not recommend AVB's for waterings systems where there is a prospective to contaminate drinking water. When one has actually stopped working, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to discover.</p>
