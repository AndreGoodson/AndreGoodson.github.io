<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. An authorization is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Be aware that softened water includes trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water contains about the same quantity of salt as a slice of bread. That's not quite salt, however for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it may be too much. If this does not work, you might need to replace among your toilet's components, normally the flapper. There may also be a problem with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
