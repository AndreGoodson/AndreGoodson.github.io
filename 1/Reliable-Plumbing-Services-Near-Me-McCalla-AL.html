<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
