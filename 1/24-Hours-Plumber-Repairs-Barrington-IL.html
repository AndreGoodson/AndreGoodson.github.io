<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Barrington IL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
