<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
