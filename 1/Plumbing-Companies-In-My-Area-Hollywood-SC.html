<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed properly, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
