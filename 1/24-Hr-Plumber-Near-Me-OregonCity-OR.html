The City of Jacksonville Building Inspection Department has actually needed the installation of backflow preventers on all commercial fire sprinkler service lines, irrigation lines and potable water lines. Commercial assemblies need to be evaluated every year.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Picture 1. Water is most likely escaping through a split or rusted overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise. In that case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is hardly ever the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>

<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water system. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
