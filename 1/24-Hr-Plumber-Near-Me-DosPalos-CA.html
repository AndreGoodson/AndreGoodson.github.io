<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
