<p>We use methods that are shown to be safe and efficient for eliminating obstructions, consisting of high-pressure water jetting.

<p>2 designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health threats but is effective against back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire combating or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can produce a suction result and draw possible pollutants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are frequently discovered in many homes. Their components are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's required. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection in between a potable drinking water system and a possible source of contamination or contamination. Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established nationwide requirements for safe drinking water. Each state is needed to impose the different regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it connects to its state laws.</p>
