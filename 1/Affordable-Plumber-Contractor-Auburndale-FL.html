<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe must be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, pierced or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
