For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled.

<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had supported into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he determined that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the newly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
