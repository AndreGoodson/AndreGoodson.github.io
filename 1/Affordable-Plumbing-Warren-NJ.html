<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the outer covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

You can purchase a disposal that currently has a cord connected if you're not comfy making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation.
