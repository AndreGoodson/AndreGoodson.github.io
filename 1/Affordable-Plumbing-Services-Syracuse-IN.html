<p>Water softeners come in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit maximum capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise protect the resin bed, so we don't need to waste area on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to launch sediment, dirt and solidity.</p>

That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
