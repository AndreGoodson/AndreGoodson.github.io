Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never happens.</p>
