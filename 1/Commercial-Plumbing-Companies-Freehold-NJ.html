Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can attain this.</p>
