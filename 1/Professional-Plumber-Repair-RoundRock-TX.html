When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
