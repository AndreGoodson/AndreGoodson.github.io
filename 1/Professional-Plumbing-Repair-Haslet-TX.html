<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Haslet TX</h3>
<p>Marin WATER is a professional plumbing and water treatment specialist situated in San Rafael, CA. We happily serve residential and commercial consumers throughout Marin County, California.

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
