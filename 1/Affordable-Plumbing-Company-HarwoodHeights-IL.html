<p>You have to spend at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a long lasting surface mechanism. The very best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be bothersome. The twist-and-drop style is much easier to utilize but needs periodic -ring replacement.</p>
