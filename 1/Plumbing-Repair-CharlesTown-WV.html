<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
