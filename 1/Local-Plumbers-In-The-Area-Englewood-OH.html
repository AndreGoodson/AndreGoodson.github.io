<p>Day to day usage should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a stable and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait till after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration.

<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for certain applications? Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental policies. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon before it can occur, avoiding infecting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the extremely advanced and complex.</p>
