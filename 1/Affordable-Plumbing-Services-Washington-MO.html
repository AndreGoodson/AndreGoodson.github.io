Additional gas line installation for new devices are charged individually.</p>
<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your household safe from the possible threats of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first location.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
