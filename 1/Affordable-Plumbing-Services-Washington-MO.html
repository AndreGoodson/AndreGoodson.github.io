Additional gas line installation for new devices are charged individually.</p>
<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your household safe from the possible threats of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the first location.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the problem.
