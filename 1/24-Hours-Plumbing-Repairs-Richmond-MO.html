<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Richmond MO</h3>
<p>A number of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide certification courses developed to train specialists to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or condominium board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file strategies with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Offense will be sent. Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to civil and criminal proceedings and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
