No, it is not a frequent incident, however it does take place more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
