<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at CoralSprings FL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system needs to be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
