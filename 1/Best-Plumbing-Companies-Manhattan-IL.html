<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Manhattan IL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
