<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
