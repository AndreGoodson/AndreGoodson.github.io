To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market.

The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
