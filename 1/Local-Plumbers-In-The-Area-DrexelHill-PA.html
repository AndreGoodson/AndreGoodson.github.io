Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. When needed, newer systems use electronic sensors that monitor bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water usage and therefore just regenerate.

Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
