<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break since you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is essential to determine the precise location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can fix the problem. The service technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
