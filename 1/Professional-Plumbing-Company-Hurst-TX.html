<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Hurst TX</h3>
<p>This is particularly common after returning from a holiday or not using your house's water supply for an extended time period. If this occurs only when your warm water is running, it might be due to a rusty warm water heater and not the plumbing pipes in your house. We have a dedicated team of experienced, highly-skilled, and professional plumbers who are at the helm of repairing all types of sinks.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
