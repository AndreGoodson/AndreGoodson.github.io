Often, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the entire toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is merely a more practical option. This typically includes cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive rust over several elements, or just because you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing supplied exceptional service for us in changing a really balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts.
