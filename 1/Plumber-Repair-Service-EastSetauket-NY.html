<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
