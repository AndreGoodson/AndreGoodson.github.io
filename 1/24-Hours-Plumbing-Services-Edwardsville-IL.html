<p>CPM Plumbing concentrates on quick service, accurate troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your service never ever has to experience downtime. You can trust the professionals at US Water Systems to provide you with a genuine water softener, you will love, not some salt-free imaginary one that doesn't soften the water. With a water softener from United States Water Systems, you will use up to 75% less soap, conserve up to 30% on water heating costs while protecting your plumbing and home appliances. It will make your clothes whiter and brighter, and naturally, it makes cleaning a breeze. You remove areas, streaks and scum on showers and components too, and among the very best parts is that you have spot-free dishes and silverware.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from ending up being an issue in your water system by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to collaborate, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surfaces like individual minerals would.</p>
