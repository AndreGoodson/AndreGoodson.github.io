Wood recommends examining the certifications of numerous companies and getting estimates.

<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or condominium board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit plans with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent. Violators will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
