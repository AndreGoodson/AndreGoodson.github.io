<p>Hidden water leaks are often stressful and have Potentially Serious Effects. Replacing your flapper might require somewhat various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
