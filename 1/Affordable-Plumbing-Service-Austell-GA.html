<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
