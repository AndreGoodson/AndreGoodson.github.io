<p>As explained previously in the short article, carbon monoxide is colorless and completely odor-free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all multi-family and single houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
