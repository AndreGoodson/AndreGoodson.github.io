<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is particularly true if you have neglected tough water, which includes extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material gradually. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is tough to repair.
