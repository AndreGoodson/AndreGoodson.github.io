<p>Follow with a plunger if the baking soda and white vinegar method does not work. Fill the sink with water and intensely plunge up and down for a number of minutes to remove the clog. When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps apply additional pressure to the clog. For obstructions that happen even more down the pipe, utilize a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, flexible steel cable wound around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap underneath the sink, making certain it is not clogged before proceeding. Pull out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the manage in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the exact same time. Repeat the procedure, taking out an extra 18 inches up until you break through the clog. Often loose debris will settle into a brand-new obstruction. Follow with a plunger, if needed.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
