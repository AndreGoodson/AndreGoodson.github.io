<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Because the hardness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You may need a professional to do this if you've never done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the inside of your hot water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as soon as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you probably have corroded piping.</p>
