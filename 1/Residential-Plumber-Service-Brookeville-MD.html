<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - mainly with sinks. In most cases, a sink drain issue is caused by excessive contaminants or particles inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are numerous chemical drain cleaning choices, often this can trigger more damage than aid. Anytime you find a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to identify the concern and advise the ideal repairs.</p>
<p>Pointer: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leaks. Backflow - Do you see water reappearing in your sink or shower?

<p>Porcelain and stainless steel sinks can last anywhere from 15 to thirty years, with porcelain sinks enduring 30 years or longer. Porcelain sinks with cast-iron cores can last the longest, and lots of porcelain sinks can be refinished several times. Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair changes to the gas piping system.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
