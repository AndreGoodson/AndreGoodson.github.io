And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can save you the trouble of those small everyday troubles - that the majority of people simply live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water wasted every day by a bad seal.</p>
