<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night EastBend NC</h3>
<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause blockages, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial home damage. Keep an eye out for damp, green spots in your backyard, a relentless sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and slow drains, as these are all typical indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, grease, silt, and sand deposits.</p>
