<p>When deciding on the correct system defense there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system.

Fire defense system are designed to match the threat that exists in the areas they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and installed to satisfy that particular risk or need.
