Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.
