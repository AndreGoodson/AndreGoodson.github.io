<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and watering, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

Journey- and master-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters regularly direct assistants and apprentices. All backflow preventers need to be installed properly. Follow the guidelines that feature the systems. Backflow preventers need to be examined yearly for proper operation. In locations where it freezes, the backflow preventer must be safeguarded from freezing. See the Irrigation System Winterization tutorial for information.</p>
