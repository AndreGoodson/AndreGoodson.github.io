Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and corrosion. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
