This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
