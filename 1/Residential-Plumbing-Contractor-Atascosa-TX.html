<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in Atascosa TX</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>If you're like most people, you've never ever even thought of it, but flushing your water heater can help it last longer and might conserve you money on energy costs by restoring the performance of the water heater. Your water heater should be flushed as soon as a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed, it may have up to eight inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank. That means eight fewer inches of hot water, not to point out the reality that your tap water is being heated up in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling germs.</p>
