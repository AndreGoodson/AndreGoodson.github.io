<p>Relatively new innovation has actually produced tankless hot water heater. Instead of, holding a set quantity of warm water, it heats it on an on-demand basis. It permits substantial energy cost savings and an endless supply of warm water. Adios cold showers! We install, repair and service all brands readily available at costs our competitors can't touch.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or disease.</p>

Sewer pipes can be notoriously difficult to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to hire someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
