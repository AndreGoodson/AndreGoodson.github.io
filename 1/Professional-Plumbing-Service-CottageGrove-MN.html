<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons recommends that you utilize hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These clever additions to your tubs and sinks can minimize the amount of hair and food scraps that end up in your drains. Lots of garbage disposals will need a new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entrance at the bottom of the sink along with a short length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>During installation, water and electrical energy are shut off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are removed and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen up the nuts that connect the drain pipe, consisting of the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a pail below the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
