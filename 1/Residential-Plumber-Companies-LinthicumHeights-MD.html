For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control.
