<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
