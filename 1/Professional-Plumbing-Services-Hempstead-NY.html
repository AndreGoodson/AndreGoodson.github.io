<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>To get rid of the cord from the old disposer, use a screwdriver to remove the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons provides annual examinations on your sewer and septic tanks.
