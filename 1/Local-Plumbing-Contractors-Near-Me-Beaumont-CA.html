<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
