<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet in LosAlamitos CA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>

<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive option.</p>
