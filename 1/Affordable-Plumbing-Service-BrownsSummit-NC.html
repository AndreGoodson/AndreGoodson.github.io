<p>There are certain plumbers who specialize in plumbing associated with home improvement and brand-new building and construction. When a brand-new house is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up properly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber might be an excellent candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specialized plumber should be used for house remodeling work.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
