<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Golden CO</h3>
<p>In most states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any natural gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or service. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your home beyond our meter, this is the exact same as other utilities, such as your electrical circuitry and pipes. When water enters your home from the main water supply line, it ought to only ever flow in one instructions: into your home.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
