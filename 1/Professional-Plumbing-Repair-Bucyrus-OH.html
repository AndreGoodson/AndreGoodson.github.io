<p>The main media included within a water softener is referred to as ion exchange resin. This resin is basically an insoluble matrix generally in the shape of little (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The product has highly developed structure of pores on the surface area of which are sites with quickly caught and launched ions.

Ion exchange resins can be made to selectively prefer one, or perhaps several different kinds of ions. Generally, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
