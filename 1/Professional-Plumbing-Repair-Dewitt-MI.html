Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
