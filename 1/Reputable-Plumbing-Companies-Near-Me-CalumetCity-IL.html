<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening just gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a danger to human health.

This can take place in multiple places and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous mixes of this type of backup.
