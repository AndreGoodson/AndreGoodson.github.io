<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of listed below grade, if less than 10-percent (small) of the existing piping for a sub-system, system, or fixture  group is changed, a license and inspection shall not be required. If so preferred, this shall not preclude the licensee from acquiring authorizations and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the cosmetics water, backpressure is created. This can require the potable water to reverse its instructions of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Prospective pollutants can then go into the potable water supply. The very best way to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that makes use of the point-of-use hot water heater; these home appliances will provide warm water continually for the period you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power concerns or if the hot water heater is faulty. In essence, it warms the water on demand with just the amount you need, thus removing the loss incurred with the use of tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
