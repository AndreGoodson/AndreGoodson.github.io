Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of hazardous pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the potable water system. This can happen through a process known as backflow.</p>

So conserve yourself some serious difficulty by being sincere with yourself about where your experience level is.</p>
