<p>Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
