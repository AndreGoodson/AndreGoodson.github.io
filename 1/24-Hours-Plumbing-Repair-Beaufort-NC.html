Water pressure may be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are a vital function in any modern-day kitchen. If you reside in an older home, your sink might not have one, requiring you to be persistent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain.
