<p>If these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink, reach for a typical household plunger. Very first seal off the 2nd side with a wet fabric or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger.

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the local system, it's still clever to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your house.</p>
