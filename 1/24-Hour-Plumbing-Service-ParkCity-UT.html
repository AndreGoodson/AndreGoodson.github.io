<p>As explained previously in the short article, carbon monoxide is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house needs to have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family homes to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
