<p>If you need a water softener is an individual preference, figuring out. A permit is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages supplied modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line.
