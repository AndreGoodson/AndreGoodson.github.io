I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole.
