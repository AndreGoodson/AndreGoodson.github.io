<p>Put your trust in a drain cleaning service technician with over 45 years of experience in drain cleaning company. These experts will ensure your drains are entirely clog-free once they're done. While a high quality, high horsepower disposal can grind and push almost anything down the kitchen sink, it doesn't indicate it's good for the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation expenses in between $52 and $138 per appliance, including labor and materials. Products cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is needed to shut off the gas to the home whenever a device needs repair or for emergency situations.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
