<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
