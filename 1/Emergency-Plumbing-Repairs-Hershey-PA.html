A hissing noise escaping close-by gas lines is indicative of a huge gas leak. If you hear the noise of air (or gas) forcibly leaking out of a pipe, you must follow safety preventative measures and resolve the leak instantly.</p>
<p>Your gas lines require routine maintenance to guarantee optimum use. Continuous usage, incorrect installation, ecological aspects, and more can trigger pipes to rust, fracture, or break.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
