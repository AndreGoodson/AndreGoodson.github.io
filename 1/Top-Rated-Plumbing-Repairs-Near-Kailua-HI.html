In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to remove little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending on the size of your home, this process will likely take a couple of days to a week to finish.

After the whole process is finished and your home is tidied up, we'll test to make sure that water is flowing effectively through all of your brand-new pipes.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
