<p>We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, courteous, proficient. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also needed to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, however we felt confident in Joe's capabilities. We decided to stick with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter costs were certainly on the high-end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
