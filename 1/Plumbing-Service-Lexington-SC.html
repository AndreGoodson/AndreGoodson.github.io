<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Lexington SC</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who deal with fundamental repairs (frequently in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who concentrate on renovating projects and additions.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
