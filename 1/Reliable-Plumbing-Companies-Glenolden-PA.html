<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the components, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This enables pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
