Big quantities of food can quickly overwhelm the system and cause a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets many phone calls asking for garbage disposal repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>They do cost quite a bit more to install and purchase, typically costing about twice that of a basic 50-gallon gas water heater. That being said, the expected lifespan of a tankless hot water heater is between 15-20 years, which is nearly double that of a tank-style.

Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in action to the water demands of your carwash.

Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
