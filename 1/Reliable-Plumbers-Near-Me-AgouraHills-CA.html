<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
