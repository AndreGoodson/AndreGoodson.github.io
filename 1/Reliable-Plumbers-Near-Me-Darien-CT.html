Mr. Singh did a minimum of 3 efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>

After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the problem.
