<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time associated. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and for that reason the total costs. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
