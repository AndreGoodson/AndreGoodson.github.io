WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise secure the resin bed, so we do not need to waste area on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regrowth to release hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>
