<h3>Blocked Drains in Flossmoor IL - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was often obstructing. They came out and dug a new route for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
