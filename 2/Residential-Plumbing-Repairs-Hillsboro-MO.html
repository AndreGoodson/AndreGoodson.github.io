<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>Does it look like your drains are constantly sluggish or clogged? Frequently, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other materials that are causing a clog in your sewer drain.
