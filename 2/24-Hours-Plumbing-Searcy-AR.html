When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can likewise cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed gradually.

<p>Most houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the issue. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
