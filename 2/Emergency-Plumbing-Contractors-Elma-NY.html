<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with potable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
