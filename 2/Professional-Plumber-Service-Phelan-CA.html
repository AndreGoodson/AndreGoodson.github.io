For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control.
