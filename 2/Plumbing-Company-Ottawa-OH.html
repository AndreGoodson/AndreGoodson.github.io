<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. Nevertheless, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a regular event, but it does take place more often than you think! Typically it occurs during the night when you do not discover the water was off for a couple of minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
