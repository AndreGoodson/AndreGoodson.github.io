<p>After arriving after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now because of some undefined quirks in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, given that I never ever want to see this company again.</p>

At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
