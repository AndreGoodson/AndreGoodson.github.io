<p>Tough water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental policies. Local building codes for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the reasonably simple to the really advanced and complex.</p>
