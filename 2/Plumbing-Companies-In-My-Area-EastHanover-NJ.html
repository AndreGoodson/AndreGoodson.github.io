<p>In local water supply systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or organisation. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach utilized. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the component).

<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the handy self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. A number of homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have talked to neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause major damage if the leak isn't discovered soon.</p>
