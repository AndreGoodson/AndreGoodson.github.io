<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping.

That's far too small to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that might warn of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the selected time period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and suggested a tool to be utilized in the future.</p>
