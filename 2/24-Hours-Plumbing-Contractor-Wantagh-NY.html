<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Wantagh NY</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (typically in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling additions and tasks.</p>
<p>Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers finish an apprenticeship program and pass the needed licensing exam to become journey-level employees. Journey-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are qualified to perform tasks independently. Plumbers with numerous years of plumbing experience who pass another exam make master status. Some states require master plumber status in order to obtain a plumbing contractor's license.</p>
