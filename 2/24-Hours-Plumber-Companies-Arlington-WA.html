<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets should definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
