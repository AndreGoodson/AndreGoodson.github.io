<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all kinds of work.

This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
