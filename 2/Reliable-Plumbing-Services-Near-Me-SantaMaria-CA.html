<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of rust control. Therefore, thinking about all these aspects, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
