<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies installed.

<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal unit will need can vary depending on how often it's used, its age, and the type of products you're putting in it. Make sure to run it often to keep it clear and always run water before and after utilizing it, as well as during for continuous feeds. While stoppers can assist, sometimes clogged drains are inescapable. When this happens, don't be reluctant to call Larry & Sons. Our group of plumbers respond to service calls quickly, and use the latest technology to target problematic areas so you can return to the comfort of your house.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you money and time as well as secure your health in the future. After softening a large amount of tough water, the exchange medium ends up being layered with calcium and magnesium ions. When this occurs, the exchange medium must be recharged or regrowed (Figure 1).
