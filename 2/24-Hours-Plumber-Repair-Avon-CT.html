<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
