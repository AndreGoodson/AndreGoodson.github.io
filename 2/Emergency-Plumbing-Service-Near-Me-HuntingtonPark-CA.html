Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is revealing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Poorly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company again.</p>

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to remove.</p>
