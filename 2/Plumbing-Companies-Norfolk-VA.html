<p>The average life expectancy of an electrical hot water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, small pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a larger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house.</p>
