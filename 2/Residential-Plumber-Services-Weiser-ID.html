<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
