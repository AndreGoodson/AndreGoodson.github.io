<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the procedure of being installed within that time, a Notification of Offense will be sent. Lawbreakers will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately lead to criminal and civil procedures and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
