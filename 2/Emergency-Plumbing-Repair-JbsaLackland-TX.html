Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise secure the resin bed, so we do not need to lose space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regeneration to launch hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>

The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
