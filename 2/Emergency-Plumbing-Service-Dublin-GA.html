<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
