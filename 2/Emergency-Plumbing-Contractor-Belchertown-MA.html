<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Belchertown MA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing task. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that requires to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
