<p>You have to spend at least $50 to get a premium kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop design is a lot easier to utilize but requires periodic -ring replacement.</p>
