<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not require fixing the entire toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes many small moving parts that may need changed with usage with time.

Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
