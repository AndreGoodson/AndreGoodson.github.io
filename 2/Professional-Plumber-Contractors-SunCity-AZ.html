Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
