<p>Pretty little flappers might get all the glory in the toilet world, but the trip lever is the bridge between guy and machine. After all, if the journey lever does not raise the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jiggle and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and lift the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work???
