<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and really responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an amazing task. I would certainly call them once again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this staining just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust most likely exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes.
