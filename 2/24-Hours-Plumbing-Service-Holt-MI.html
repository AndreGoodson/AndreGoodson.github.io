When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to municipal storm drains or street seamless gutters, they often become clogged with tree roots and debris.

You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet.
