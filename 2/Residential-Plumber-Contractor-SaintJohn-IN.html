Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Since of the fundamental design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, varying supply pressure on an extremely low flow or fixed circulation condition may trigger annoyance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will frequently hold the pressure continuous to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
