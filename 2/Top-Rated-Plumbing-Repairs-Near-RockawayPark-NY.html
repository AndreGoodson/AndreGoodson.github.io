It's particularly crucial to make certain your water softener is located before your hot water heater, as difficult water does the best damage to warm water devices. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level place, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near to the water's main line, an electrical outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the brine service from the regeneration cycle.</p>
