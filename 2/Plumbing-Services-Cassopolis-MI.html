Low Circulation Toilets: While low flow toilets are terrific at saving you cash on your water bills, some older designs lack the flushing power to effectively remove waste, which causes accumulations.</p>
<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
