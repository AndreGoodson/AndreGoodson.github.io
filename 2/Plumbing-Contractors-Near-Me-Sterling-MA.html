<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel.

After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
