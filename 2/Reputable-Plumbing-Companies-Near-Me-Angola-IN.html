<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures unusable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. Sometimes drain repair needs can be resolved reasonably quickly by a skilled handyman. At other times, nevertheless, parts of a drain might need to be taken apart, examined, and cleared prior to being changed. In many cases, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is required (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to discuss repair options.</p>
<p>You need to invest at least $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a long lasting finish mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can use, but screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop style is much easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
