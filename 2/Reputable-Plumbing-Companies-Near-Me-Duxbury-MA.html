<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically 2 layers of protection. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is entering into the building, however closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect method. There are 2 various kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are frequently specified-- a reduced pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention however do not get hung up on them. I discuss them just because they will be on a certification test.</p>
