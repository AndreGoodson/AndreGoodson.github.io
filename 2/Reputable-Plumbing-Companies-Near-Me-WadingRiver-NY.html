Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended uses around your house.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, along with checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
