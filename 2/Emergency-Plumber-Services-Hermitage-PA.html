<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers must just be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
