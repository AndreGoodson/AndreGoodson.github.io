<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your home. Even if the problem stems with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has needed numerous repairs over the last couple of years. A good general rule for hot water heater is this: because the life expectancy of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>Other indications you might need to repipe include rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to determine the very best strategy.</p>
