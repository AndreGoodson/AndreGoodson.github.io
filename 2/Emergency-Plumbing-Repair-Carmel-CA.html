<h3>How To Deal With A Plumbing Emergency Carmel CA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
