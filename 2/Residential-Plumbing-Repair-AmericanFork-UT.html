<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgery, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-term service if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your home. This can occur in numerous locations and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in tough water can trigger a bad smell and taste. When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
