<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the service. The particles of calcium integrate, become heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment procedure. Flexible gas lines are normally more suitable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural disaster which decreases the threat of an explosion or fire.</p>

<p>Softeners mainly get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'hardness minerals'.
