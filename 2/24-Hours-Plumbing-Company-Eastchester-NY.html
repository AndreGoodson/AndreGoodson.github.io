<p>A plumbing permit provides for three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the reason for the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
