<p>In most cases, the toilet can be repaired rather than changed, since the problem frequently boils down to a single element or two. Sometimes, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is simply a more practical option. This usually includes fractures in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over multiple components, or just because you  wish to replace your existing toilet with something more aesthetically pleasing.</p>

When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation happens, infected water might be drawn into the system.
