<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
