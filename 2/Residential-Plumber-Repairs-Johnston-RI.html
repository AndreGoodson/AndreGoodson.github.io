<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience obstructions in several drains simultaneously in your house, then that normally means that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple places and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
