When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
