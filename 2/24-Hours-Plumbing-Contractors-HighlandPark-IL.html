<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take obligation if it dripped now since of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
