<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
