<p>Release piping linked to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices suggests a DCV assembly on damp or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
