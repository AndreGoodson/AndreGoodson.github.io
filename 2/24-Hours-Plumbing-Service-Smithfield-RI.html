<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
