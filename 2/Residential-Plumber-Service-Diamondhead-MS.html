<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is one of the least costly backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health threat or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to likewise be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
