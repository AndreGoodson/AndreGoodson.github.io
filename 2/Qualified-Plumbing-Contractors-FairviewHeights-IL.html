In time, dirt, particles, hair, and countless other small particles can get trapped and develop in your pipes. Ultimately, the water might not have the ability to drain quickly or efficiently, and you may experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously backing up. When this happens, it may be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine.</p>
