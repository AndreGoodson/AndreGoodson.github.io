<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day.
