<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a lot of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers normally charge for drain snaking. The waste disposal unit is clogged or slowly draining. While a garbage disposal is an useful tool, not all food waste can be put through a waste disposal unit, resulting in obstructions.
