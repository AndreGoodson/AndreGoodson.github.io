<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Maiden NC</h3>
<p>The most effective method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>In local water supply systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may happen when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario happens, polluted water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an occurrence, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention approach used. The very best and safest kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
