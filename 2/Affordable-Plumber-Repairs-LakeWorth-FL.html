<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Water softeners been available in all shapes and sizes and larger absolutely does not mean better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually offer more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused.
