Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

Your house is over 10 years old, and you have never had the sewer and drain lines checked. Some plumbers may get professional discount rates from sellers or kitchen and bath display rooms. If you need a brand-new sink or faucet, compare their costs with what you can find online or at home enhancement stores. They might be getting you a much better offer</p>
