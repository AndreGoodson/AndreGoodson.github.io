<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
