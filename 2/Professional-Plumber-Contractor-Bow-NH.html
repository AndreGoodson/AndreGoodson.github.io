Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older communities where clay pipe may have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be doubly compounded if pipes have actually been enabled to freeze.</p>
<p>There are several signs to watch out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm or even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all home appliances and fixtures in your home have been turned off. 3) The water heater appears to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to higher gas and water bills, in some cases extremely rapidly.</p>
