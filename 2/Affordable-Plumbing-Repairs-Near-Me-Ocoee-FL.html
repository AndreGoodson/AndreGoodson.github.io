Using these chemicals frequently can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>If you're like most people, you have actually never ever even thought of it, however flushing your water heater can help it last longer and might conserve you money on energy expenses by restoring the effectiveness of the water heater. Your hot water heater ought to be flushed once a year. If you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed, it may have up to eight inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank.
