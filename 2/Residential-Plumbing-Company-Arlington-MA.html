<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the magnificence in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge between man and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you need to jerk and wiggle and in some cases even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper by hand. And who wishes to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, making sure your journey lever is working well can conserve you the hassle of those small day-to-day hassles - that many people simply cope with and never realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water squandered every day by a bad seal.</p>
