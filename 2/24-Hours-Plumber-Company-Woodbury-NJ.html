<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a service of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products containing extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
