<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the very first most apparent indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can indicate a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the municipal system, it's still clever to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Say you choose to go that path. The next question is whether you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a knowledgeable helpful person, but you have actually never handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, supplying you do your homework. I would draw the line at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other customized models). Their installation ought to be managed by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
