<p>There's a good chance the existing drain pipes can be used if you're changing an old system. As we discussed at the start, it's great to get whatever found out beforehand to save a rushed journey to the shop. If the existing pipes are sufficient, you'll find out instantly upon mounting. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver female believed the price she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was excessive. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things in a different way might have conserved her a great deal of cash.</p>
<p>She learnt about the service call fee. The 4 On Your Side Investigation found that's a common fee. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the circumstance prior to committing to a rate, and all wished to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks discovered just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
