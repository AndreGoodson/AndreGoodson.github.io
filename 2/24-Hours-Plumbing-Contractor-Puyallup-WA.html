<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Puyallup WA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
