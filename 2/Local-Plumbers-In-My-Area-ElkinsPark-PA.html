<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service ElkinsPark PA</h3>
<p>Marin H2O is a professional plumbing and water treatment specialist situated in San Rafael, CA. We happily serve commercial and residential consumers throughout Marin County, California. Does your water taste bad? Does it leave a milky residue on your fixtures and counters? No matter what problems you're having with your faucet water, RainSoft has the perfect solution.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
