<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
