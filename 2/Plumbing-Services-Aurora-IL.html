<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought separately from the disposal unit.

<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting just wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey choice.</p>
