<p>The repair technician should be able to determine the many different makers and the specific designs produced throughout the years. Some models may seem similar on the outside however might require different repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician must have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced. Sometimes the serial number of the assembly will be required to differentiate one model from another. It is necessary to know the right model to ensure you get the correct repair parts.</p>
<p>A plumbing permit offers three inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections contacted on work not finished, not properly set up, or on an inaccessible property will need re-inspection.
