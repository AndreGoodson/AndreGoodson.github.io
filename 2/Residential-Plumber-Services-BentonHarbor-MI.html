<p>The most convenient way to eliminate the hardness is by filtering your water through a water softener. Softening your water down to the optimum level of 6 grains of hardness is ideal for household use due to the fact that the water remains less corrosive than over-softened water and is free of scale producing firmness.

<p>The system has actually returned to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). However, particles in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Examine from closing all the way. This permits pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the RV Discharge.</p>
