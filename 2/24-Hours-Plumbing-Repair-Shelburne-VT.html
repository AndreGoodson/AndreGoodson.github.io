<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which designs are best for certain applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building codes for example will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the extremely sophisticated and complicated.</p>

<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, however it is also very unusual. They were made so as to offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
