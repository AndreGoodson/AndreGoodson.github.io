<p>Obvious odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or throughout your house or service area, offer us a call. That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be changed rather than fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty odors, you'll understand this.</p>

Your local Culligan Man will review the hardness of your water, the size of your household and even your home's plumbing before suggesting the best water softening solution for you and your spending plan.

In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
