Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
