<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>To plumb the disposer's drain outlet, fit the rubber washer over the flanged end of the plastic crosspiece, then slide the metal flange on from the other end. Suggestion the bottom of the metal flange into its slot in the disposer and tighten the fastening bolt through the top of the flange.
