<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>You'll observe that water runs to refill the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in an effectively working toilet, the water needs to stop running once the bowl is filled to its appropriate capability. Possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leakages are very inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
