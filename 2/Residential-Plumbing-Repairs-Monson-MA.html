<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
