<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the firmness itself.

Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
