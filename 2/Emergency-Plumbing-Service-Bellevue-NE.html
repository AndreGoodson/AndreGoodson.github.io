<p>The repair specialist should have the ability to determine the lots of various manufacturers and the particular designs produced throughout the years. Some designs may appear similar on the outside but might need various repair parts on the inside, so the repair professional must have the ability to determine the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. In some cases the serial number of the assembly will be needed to separate one model from another. It is very important to know the proper design to guarantee you get the right repair parts.</p>
<p>When pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the make-up water, backpressure is produced. This can require the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the drinkable water supply. The best method to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We advise, as a lot of plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
