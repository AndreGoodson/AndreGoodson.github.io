<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
