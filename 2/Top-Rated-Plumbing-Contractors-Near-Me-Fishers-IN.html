To make it soft, you need to eliminate the minerals. That's the main difference in between soft and hard water The presence of the minerals in the water can reveal itself in a range of methods.</p>

This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Possible impurities can then go into the potable water supply. The very best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

From the lack of suds development in bathing and laundry applications to the pricey breakdowns in boilers, cooling towers and other equipment that manage water, water hardness is a major concern.</p>
