<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Murrysville PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
