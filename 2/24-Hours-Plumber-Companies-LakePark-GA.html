<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
