<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
