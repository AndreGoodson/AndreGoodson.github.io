<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
