<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system should be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems utilize UV light to destroy micro-organisms and provide cleansed water. The cost is approximately the same for setting up a lp gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have gas go to the house. Find out which kind of gas your home presently has.
