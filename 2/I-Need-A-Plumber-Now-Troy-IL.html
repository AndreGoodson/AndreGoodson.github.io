<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Troy IL?</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous designated usages around your house.</p>
<p>If you have a garbage disposal, you can try disposing a tray of ice cubes down the drain, and then switch on the waste disposal unit while running water.
