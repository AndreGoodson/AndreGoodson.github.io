<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more substantial costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET offered by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
