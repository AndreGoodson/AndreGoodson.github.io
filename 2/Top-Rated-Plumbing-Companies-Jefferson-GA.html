<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
