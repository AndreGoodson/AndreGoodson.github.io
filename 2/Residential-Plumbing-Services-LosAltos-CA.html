<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they ought to be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
