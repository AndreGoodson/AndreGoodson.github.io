<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.

<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Hull MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
