<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

<p>A minimum of once every three months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and go with a patching task rather of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same product and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire home when you find a leak.</p>
