<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening simply eliminates solidity minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your home.

For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
