Tankless hot water heater get rid of the long wait for heat of the conventional warm water tank. Plumbing pipes, like whatever else, wear out over time. Normally, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too comprehensive for repair.

<p>As described previously in the article, carbon monoxide gas is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home should have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate areas.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
