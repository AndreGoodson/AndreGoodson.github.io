<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>

Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would provide an estimate over the phone.

Brooks found only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
