Scale lowers circulation through pipes and is a bad conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can end up being completely clogged.</p>
<p>Energy Effectiveness. Picking a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star rating is advisable. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is shown by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the hot water heater the greater the EF score. Nevertheless, just because a hot water heater has a higher EF value, it doesn't always indicate it will have lower operating costs. You also need to think about the fuel source.</p>
