Pinhole leakages, for instance, are so small that they only release a couple of beads at a time. That's far too small to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that may alert of a leak in the system. A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the appointed period. They disconnected the sinks, cleaned up and advised a tool to be utilized in the future.</p>

If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and regular leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and much better long-lasting option.</p>
