Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>

These leaks are extremely inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
