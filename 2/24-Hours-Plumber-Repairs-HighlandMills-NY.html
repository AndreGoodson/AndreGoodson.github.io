<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was frequently clogging. They came out and dug a brand-new route for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever. It was brutally hot and I actually value their hard work to allow us to utilize our water facilities again. Had a fantastic experience with these folks. I extremely recommend their services.</p>
<p>2 designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an independently acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health threats but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
