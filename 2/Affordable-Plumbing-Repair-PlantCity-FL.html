<p>The next action we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to ensure the line is properly flushed.</p>

When this occurs, it might be time to contact a professional from Atlas Plumbing to investigate.</p>
