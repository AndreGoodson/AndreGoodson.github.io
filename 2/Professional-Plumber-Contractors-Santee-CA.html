Gas shut-off valve installation expenses between $52 and $138 per appliance, consisting of labor and products. Products cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour.

That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
