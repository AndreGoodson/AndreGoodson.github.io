<p>Covert water leakages are typically stressful and have Possibly Severe Consequences. Changing your flapper may require slightly various actions than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>

That is why we offer a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a dye test.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
