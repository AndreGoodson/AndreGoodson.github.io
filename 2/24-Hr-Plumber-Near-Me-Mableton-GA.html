<p>If you need a water softener is an individual choice, determining. A permit is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
