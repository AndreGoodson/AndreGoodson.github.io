<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in TwinLakes WI</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>The easiest method to keep you and your household safe from the potential hazards of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first place. However, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
