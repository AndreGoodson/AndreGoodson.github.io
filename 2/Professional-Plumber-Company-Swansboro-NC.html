These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
