<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies WestHills CA</h3>
<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to supplying a substantial line of backflow preventers, the majority of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing components meet and go beyond the requirements established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Recent changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing components, valves, pipes, and fittings that are straight meant for human water consumption are required to be manufactured with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass content. Zurn Wilkins plumbing items that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," meaning they are certified.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
