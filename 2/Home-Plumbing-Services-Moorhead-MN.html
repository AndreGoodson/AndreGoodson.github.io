<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that only original factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to utilize and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>All equipment or systems provided by potable water lines that might go through contamination should have airgaps (Ct. Regs. ยง 19-13-38a( b )). These consist of devices such as washing tanks, pesticide and herbicide holding tanks or components used to include solutions of chemicals. We'll repair your toilet or install a brand-new one (whichever service you select) as soon as you agree to a rate. We'll clean up any mess we make and leave your bathroom clean.</p>
