However if your toilet is displaying any of the following signs, it may be time to replace it. When a water account is established, we assess backflow requirements for companies on a private basis. After getting rid of standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>
