<p>Backflow preventers are critical for producing a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be appropriately preserved. The salt water solution should be mixed and kept in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin likewise needs special attention. For instance, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. However, check out the producer's instructions prior to adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
<p>Once the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will build up.</p>
