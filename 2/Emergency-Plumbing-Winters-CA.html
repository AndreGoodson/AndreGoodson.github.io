<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
