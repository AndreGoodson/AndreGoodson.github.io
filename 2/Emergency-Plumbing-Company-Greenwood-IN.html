The metal pipes are galvanized steel or iron, brass, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec.

Plastic pipes also have questionable signing up with methods. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and lead to water damage. Plastics end up being breakable with age and heat. There are likewise issues about the molecular structure of plastics and the resins from which they are made.</p>
