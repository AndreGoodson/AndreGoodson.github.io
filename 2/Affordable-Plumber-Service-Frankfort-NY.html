<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
