<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental policies. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, preventing contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complicated and advanced backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the fairly simple to the extremely sophisticated and complicated.</p>

You'll need to dismantle the drain and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall.

<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
