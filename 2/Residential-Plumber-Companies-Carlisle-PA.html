<p>Since the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside, New homes constructed with copper pipes are particularly vulnerable to destructive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

Liquified calcium and magnesium speed up out of tough water as scale, which builds up on the insides of pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee makers and commercial machinery. Scale lowers flow through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Eventually, pipes can end up being entirely clogged.</p>
