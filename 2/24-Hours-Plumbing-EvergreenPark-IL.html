<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
