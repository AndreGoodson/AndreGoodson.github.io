<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in NewBern NC</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
