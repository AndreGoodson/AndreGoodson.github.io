<p>Concealed water leakages are typically difficult and have Possibly Major Consequences. Changing your flapper may require a little various actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job.
