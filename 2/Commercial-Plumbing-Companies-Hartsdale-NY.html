<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Hartsdale NY</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
