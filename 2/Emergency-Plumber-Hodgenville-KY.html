<p>During normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside.

For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
