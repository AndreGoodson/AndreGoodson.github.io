<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, but the journey lever is the bridge between guy and machine. After all, if the journey lever doesn't lift the flapper to flush the toilet, you have to jiggle and wiggle and sometimes even stick your hand in there and raise the flapper manually. And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your journey lever is working well can save you the hassle of those little daily inconveniences - that the majority of people simply live with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to point out the gallons of water squandered every day by a poor seal.</p>
