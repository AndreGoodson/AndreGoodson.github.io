<p>Day to day use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a stable and safe area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth, you need to wait until after the cycle is completed and after that inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>

Based on research carried out by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Study, 2011.</p>
<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
