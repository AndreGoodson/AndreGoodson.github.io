These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
