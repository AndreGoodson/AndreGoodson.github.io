<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
