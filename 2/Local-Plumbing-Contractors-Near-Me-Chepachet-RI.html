<p>The most effective method to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and really responsive to send me a bid which was very competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome job. I would certainly call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still an issue that needs to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
