<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in LoneTree CO</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist figure out.</p>
