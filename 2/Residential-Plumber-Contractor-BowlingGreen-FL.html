<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
