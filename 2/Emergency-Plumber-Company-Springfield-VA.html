If you smell a strong whiff of gas from your cars and truck when it is running, you might have a gas leak from the fuel line. It is essential to repair this right away to prevent a surge.

<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have failed. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the basic HO-3 property owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the result of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance agent and confirm your coverage. Once you have actually reviewed your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered, double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is appropriate.</p>
