<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll notice that water goes to refill the bowl. However, in a properly working toilet, the water should stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its proper capacity. Chances are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection between a drinkable drinking water supply and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established nationwide standards for safe drinking water. Each state is required to impose the numerous regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it relates to its state laws.</p>
