<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct result on your safety, convenience, convenience, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is extremely crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet provides to push the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use salt pellets in the salt water tank, but then install a reverse-osmosis water filter at the kitchen sink. The filter will eliminate salt from the water, which you can utilize for drinking and cooking. From multi-tank systems powered by the energy of moving water to a more traditional method, Kinetico covers all your choices. Your local Kinetico water professional will work with you to choose the water softener that's right for you.</p>
