<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately experiences deterioration and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
