<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century.
