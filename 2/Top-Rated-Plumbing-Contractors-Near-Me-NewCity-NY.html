<p>When picking the correct system defense there are a number of considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on a private basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the danger that exists in the places they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An aircraft garage will need a very different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ significantly.</p>
