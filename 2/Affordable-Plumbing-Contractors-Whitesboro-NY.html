<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers need to only be fixed when the information collected from the field test suggests the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
