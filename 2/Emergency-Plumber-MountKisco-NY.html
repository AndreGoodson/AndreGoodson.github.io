<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or service, and its ability to function is essential. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a big clog.

Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
