Every house must have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the appropriate places.

<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment constructs at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon approximately helps eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping task, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the same material and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak.</p>
