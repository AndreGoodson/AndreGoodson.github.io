<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these aspects, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
