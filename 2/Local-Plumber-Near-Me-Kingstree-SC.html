<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system supplying the makeup water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then enter the potable water system. The best way to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least when a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly difficult with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>For the most part, a lack of hot water is triggered by a faulty circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be broken if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and need to be immediately attended to by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
