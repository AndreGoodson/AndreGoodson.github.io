In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can purchase designs with special features that do whatever but add the salt, you will spend for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the special function will not fail.

Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This might or might not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
