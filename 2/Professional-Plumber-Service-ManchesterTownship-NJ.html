It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical power during peak durations such as very early in the early morning and at night. Utilizing your heater throughout these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is cheap and has a set rate. Another disadvantage of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be expensive to install, specifically when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
