Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the home.</p>

Company then typically blow the liner into an existing pipe. You will most likely have old pipes that need replacing if your house was developed prior to the 1970s or hasn't been renovated.</p>
