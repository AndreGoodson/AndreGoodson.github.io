For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners utilize sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection.
