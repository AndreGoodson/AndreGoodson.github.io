<p>Sewer lines have one essential role: bring wastewater out of a house or building. Tankless water heaters are becoming a growing number of popular with homeowners.

<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
