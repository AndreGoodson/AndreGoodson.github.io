One way to check for any leaks in your plumbing is to shut off all water home appliances in your home and outdoors (sprinklers, tubes, etc.). Then find and see the numbers on your home's water meter. If the numbers increase after 20-30 minutes, you have a leak. And the faster those numbers go up, the larger the leak.</p>
