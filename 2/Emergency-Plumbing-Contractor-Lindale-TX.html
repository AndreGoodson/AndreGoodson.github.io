This is specifically real if you have untreated tough water, which contains harsh minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material with time.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
