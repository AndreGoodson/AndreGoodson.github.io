<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement.
