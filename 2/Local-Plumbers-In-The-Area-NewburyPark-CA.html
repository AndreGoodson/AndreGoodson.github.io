<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, dishwasher, and boiler, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but over time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can dramatically restrict the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
