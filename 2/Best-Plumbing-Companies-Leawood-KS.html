<p>The process of regrowth can utilize 25 gallons of water or more daily, or approximately 10,000 gallons per year. Current improvements in water softening innovation, nevertheless, have lowered this water usage and showed that there is great potential for water savings. WaterSense thinks there is a chance to capitalize on this water savings chance, raise customer awareness, and further improve the efficiency of water softeners.</p>
<p>Difficult water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>

The heating temperature is typically pre-set to fit your needs and choices. Tankless electrical water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters because they just heat water when needed.</p>
