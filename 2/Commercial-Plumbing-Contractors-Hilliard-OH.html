We understand that clogged toilets and other toilet issues are the very epitome of hassle, which is why you want them to work effectively and have concerns taken care of them as quickly as they develop.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
