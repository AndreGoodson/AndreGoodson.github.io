With our professional garbage disposal replacement and installation services, you can be confident that you're all set for many years of reliable service. No, the glass will not hone the waste disposal unit blades. To clean and hone the blades, grind a couple of ice in the disposal before running cold water through the system.

<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to go into the valve and restore pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
