A permit is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
