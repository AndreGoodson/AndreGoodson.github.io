<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
